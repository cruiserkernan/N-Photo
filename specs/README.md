# Specs

This folder contains project specs used to drive implementation.

## Structure
- `architecture/`: system-level design, boundaries, and invariants.
- `features/`: user-facing behavior and acceptance criteria.

## Usage
1. Create or update an architecture spec first when changing core design.
2. Create feature specs that reference architecture specs.
3. Keep status and dates current in each spec file.
